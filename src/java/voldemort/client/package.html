    The user facing interface to Voldemort.  This package includes the StoreClient implementation that the user sees and the factory 
    responsible for bootstrapping the client.
    
    HttpStoreClientFactory and SocketStoreClientFactory both abstract away the threadpool and configuration that is shared 
    between all the {@link voldemort.client.StoreClient StoreClients} that they will produce.
